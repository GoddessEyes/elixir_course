## Map.update

```
results =
Map.update(
  results, # look in this map
  hash, # for an entry with key
  [ path ], # if not found, store this value
  fn existing -> # else update with result of this fn
    [ path | existing ]
  end)
```

This wonderful function takes a map, a key, an initial value, and a function. 
If the key is not present in the map, then a new map is returned 
with that key and initial value added. 
If the key is present, then the corresponding value is passed to the function, 
and whatever the function returns becomes the updated value in the returned map.

## Nested data structures

If you have a hierarchical data, you can't directly modify part of it.
You have to walk down the tree to the particular part that needs to be modified, 
and then transform it, and all its ancestors.
The result is a copy of entire model.
