# Solving FizzBuzz

Before we start learning Elixir let's just taste it with a simple task [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz):

We need to write a programm which iterates over numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3 the programm should print "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5 the programm should print "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 the programm should print "FizzBuzz". And in all other cases the programm should print the number itself.

It's a simple task which shows many Elixir features such as:
- modules and functions;
- generating a sequence of numbers with `Range`;
- iterating over the sequence with `Enum.each`;
- control flow with `cond do`;
- guards;
- printing to stdout;
- pipe operator;
- and unit tests.

We don't dive deep into details right now but just look at those features.
